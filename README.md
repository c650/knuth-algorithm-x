# Donald Knuth's Algorithm X

[Donald Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) can be used to determine the subcollection `S*` of collection `S` of subsets of `X` such that each element `X` is contained in _exactly_ one subset in `S*`. Such a subcollection `S*` is the [exact cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) of the set `X`.
